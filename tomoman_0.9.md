TOMOMAN 0.9

TOMOMAN, i.e. TOMOgram MANager, is a MATLAB package for managing 
the various preprocessing steps for taking raw data to reconstructed 
tomograms. TOMOMAN mainly acts as a set of wrapper scripts for 
external packages, managing the input and outputs of each external 
module to form a cohesive pipeline. Preprocessing metadata is 
collected into the TOMOMAN "tomolist" (default name tomolist.mat) 
while output is written to a plain-text log file 
(default name: tomoman.log).


Supplied is the source code, a set of example bash scripts, parmeter 
files, and instructions on how to compile and run TOMOMAN. Pre-compiled 
binaries are also supplied; these were compiled using MATLAB R2020b.
