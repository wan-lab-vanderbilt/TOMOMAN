Do you know what astigmatism is present?
Known astigmatism 
Known astigmatism angle

Slower, more exhaustive search? % This block is removed when astigmatism is known
Use a restraint on astigmatism?
Expected (tolerated) astigmatism % Disappears of no restraint is used


Find additional phase shift?
Minimum phase shift (rad)
Maximum phase shift (rad)
Phase shift search step

Do you want to set expert options?
Resample micrograph if pixel size too small?
